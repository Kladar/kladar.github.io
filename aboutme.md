I've never quite found the right title. Mostly I care about the climate and do storytelling with data. More recently I build tools to help others tell stories, which can often be all the more fulfilling. I think you can get pretty far with Python, SQL, and maybe occasionally just a little bit of JavaScript. 

I've worked for several startups, which you can never tell if they are about to die or about to change your life with success. I even took one ride all the way through an IPO. But I don't think I'm cut out for the corporate world. I tend to have some strong opinions and like to take shortcuts. I tend to be a bit polarizing (which always comes as a surprise to me as I am never trying to be), but I actually like that outcome. I'd rather have 10 passionate collaborators who believe in me and I in them than 100 lukewarm ones that you can never quite tell what they're thinking.

AI has changed my day-to-day experience as a developer in a radically short time period. And a lot of people are saying AI has changed the game of software engineering. I think the game's the same; just got more fierce.
